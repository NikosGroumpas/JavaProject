# JavaProject
A java project where it miniatures a contacts app. Since it is not connected to a database, initally a menu pops up to ask the user to input userswith some of their data
and then, in the same loop, it can search them by name.
Data is stored on an array, though the same thing can be done with an ArrayList.
